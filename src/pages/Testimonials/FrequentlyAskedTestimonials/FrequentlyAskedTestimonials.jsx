                  There aren’t any agreements. You are not confined. There are no conditions if you’re unhappy. Naturally, we’ll do every effort to ensure that your firm attracts the precise kind of clients you desire. We ask for a 30-day notice if, for any reason, you’re dissatisfied before pausing or terminating your account.

                  Once more, this is “per case” basis. If you don’t know what you’re doing and only have $1,000 to spend, you could easily squander it all in one day. We establish daily restrictions for Google Ads management based on the number of leads you wish to receive each month.

                  We would love to be able to promise you a certain amount of leads each day, but it would be impossible given the fluctuating number of people who are actively looking for your service in your target area each day. We want you to appear in as many searches as we can, making you the first business they call. The amount of money you spend each month on advertising also affects how many leads you receive each day. Budgets appeal to us.
