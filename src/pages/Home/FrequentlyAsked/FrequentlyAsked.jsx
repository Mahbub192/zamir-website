              How much does online marketing cost?
              </div>
              <div className="collapse-content">
                <p>
                Many different factors determine the cost of online marketing. Every one of our clients is willing to spend a specific amount of money based on how many areas they are servicing. It really depends on how many leads you want to receive in a month and how competitive is your local area.

              Can I generate leads for free?
              </div>
              <div className="collapse-content">
                <p>
                Yes! There are many ways to generate leads for your business. We all love free. Our favorite free method to generate leads is to create and optimize your Google My Business account. You’ll be able to get reviews, and reviews help you get more customers when prospects are searching for your business. Having a Google My Business profile seriously enhances your overall marketing efforts.

              How do I schedule a call with you?
              </div>
              <div className="collapse-content">
                <p>
                It’s simple. All you have to do is click the button to schedule a call with us. You’ll be asked to fill out an application, so we get to know you and your business before our call. On the call, we’ll be able to help you immediately if you answer the questions honestly.

              Is there a contract to work with you?
              </div>
              <div className="collapse-content">
                <p>
                There are no contracts. You’re not tied down. If you’re not happy, there are no strings attached. Obviously, we’ll do everything in our power to make sure you are getting the exact customers you want for your business. If for whatever reason, you’re unhappy, we request a 30-day notice before either putting your account on pause or canceling altogether.

              <div className="collapse-content">
                <p>
                Again, this is on a “per case” basis. If you only have $1,000 to spend, you could easily go through $1,000 in a day if you don’t know what you’re doing. If we’re managing your Google Ads for you, we set daily limits based on how many leads you want to get each month.

              <div className="collapse-content">
                <p>
                We wish we could give you a guaranteed number of leads per day, but it all depends on how many people are searching for your service in your targeted area daily. We aim to get you to pop up for as many searches as possible, so you’re the first company they call. The number of leads per day also depends on how much money you spend each month on ads. We like budgets.

                <p>
                The custom rental website will be given to our clients. If you become our client, we’ll gift you the site 100% free of charge. If you just want the website, we can build it for you, but it’s cheaper for you just to hire us to run your Google Ads.

                Yes! We’re amazing at managing any of the popular social platforms like Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest, and more. However, what we love MOST is Google Ads. We’re the leading experts in generating leads using Google Ads.
